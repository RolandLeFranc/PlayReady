# PlayReady Products
   
  
Microsoft PlayReady makes it easier for device builders to enable scenarios involving license acquisition from devices. With PlayReady, Microsoft has updated many of the protocols to make communication from devices to servers easier. Additionally, Microsoft PlayReady includes features that make it easier for devices to co-exist with other DRM clients, such as personal computers.
  
PlayReady has been designed with mobile devices in mind. Mobile devices, enhanced through PlayReady, are capable of communicating with media content services without the need for connecting through a personal computer. It is much easier for device builders to enable media store integration for connected devices such as tablets and mobile phones than it has been historically. PlayReady adds numerous features including but not limited to:

   *  Envelope packaging for protecting packaged content for arbitrary data.

   *  Domain support for managing clients.

   *  Support for embedded licenses to enable more seamless content access.

   *  Support for audio/video in formats other than Windows Media.

   *  Performance enhancements.
