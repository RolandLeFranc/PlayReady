# PlayReady for Windows
   
  
 The PlayReady PC SDK v1.3.0, designed for desktop PC apps, is deprecated and should not be used. 
 
 For Windows Store apps (Windows 8.1) and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, this functionality originally provided by the PlayReady PC SDK has been integrated into the Windows SDK. For more information about PlayReady on UWP apps, see the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt429381.aspx). For Windows 8.1 reference, see [Developing PlayReady Windows Store and Web Apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn468834.aspx). 

 Some PlayReady Partners provide SDKs to run PlayReady on Windows 7 and Mac OS, based on Electron, Xamarin, or other technologies. You can contact these [PlayReady Partners](https://www.microsoft.com/playready/partners/) directly for more information.
